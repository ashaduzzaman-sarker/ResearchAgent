      "[{'title': 'BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data Generation', 'summary': \"Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress\\nof computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in\\nrobotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop\\nmore generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,\\nrobotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic\\ntasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically\\nsuffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this\\nproblem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies\\nfrom automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot\\ncapabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for\\ndiverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to\\nfinetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human\\nsupervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's\\nstate, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based\\nmanipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly\\nimprove zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.\\nMoreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables\\ndownscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on\\nthe project page.\", 'authors': ['Rocktim Jyoti Das', 'Harsh Singh', 'Diana Turmakhan', 'Muhammad Abdullah Sohail', 'Mingfei Han', 'Preslav Nakov', 'Fabio Pizzati', 'Ivan Laptev'], 'arxiv_id': '2510.08572v1', 'url': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08572v1', 'pdf_link': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08572v1'}, {'title': 'NovaFlow: Zero-Shot Manipulation via Actionable Flow from Generated Videos', 'summary': 'Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central\\ngoal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on\\nfine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.\\nWe present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task\\ndescription into an actionable plan for a target robot without any\\ndemonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a\\nvideo generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using\\noff-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative\\nposes for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals\\nand trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a\\ntracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics\\nmodel. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow\\nnaturally transfers across embodiments.

      "final_answer.invoke(input={'introduction': 'Dynamic Backtracking AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are two fascinating areas in artificial intelligence that have garnered significant attention. Dynamic Backtracking AI focuses on improving search algorithms, while LLMs are at the forefront of natural language processing and understanding.', 'research_steps': \"1. Conducted a RAG search for 'Dynamic Backtracking AI' to gather specialized information.\\n2. Performed a web search to find general knowledge about Dynamic Backtracking AI.\\n3. Conducted a RAG search for 'LLMs' to gather specialized information on large language models.\", 'main_body': 'Dynamic Backtracking AI is an advanced search technique that enhances traditional backtracking methods by allowing backtrack points to be moved deeper into the search space. This approach helps in avoiding the pitfalls of static backtracking, such as getting stuck in local minima or redundant paths. The technique is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking, which uses polynomial space while providing useful control information. This method is particularly useful in complex problem-solving scenarios where traditional methods may falter due to their rigidity.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) like BLAZER and others are revolutionizing the field of AI by enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text. These models are trained on vast datasets and can perform a variety of tasks, from simple text generation to complex reasoning and manipulation tasks. For instance, BLAZER uses a fully automatic pipeline to train LLM-based manipulation agents without manual supervision, showcasing the potential of LLMs in automating and improving task performance. LLMs are also being used to assist in writing, editing, and even brainstorming, making them invaluable tools in both academic and practical applications.', 'conclusion': 'Dynamic Backtracking AI and LLMs represent two cutting-edge areas in AI research. While Dynamic Backtracking AI offers innovative solutions to improve search algorithms, LLMs are pushing the boundaries of what machines can achieve in understanding and generating human language. Both fields continue to evolve, promising exciting developments in the future.', 'sources': '- RAG search results on Dynamic Backtracking AI\\n- Web search results on Dynamic Backtracking AI\\n- RAG search results on LLMs'})\n"
